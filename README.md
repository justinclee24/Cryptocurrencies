# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this repository is to utilize unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies grouped by classification relative to their features.
This classification report could be utilized by an investment firm to propose new cryptocurrency investments portfolio to its clients.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

Preprocessing the database,
Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

- Scatter plot using "TotalCoinsMined" and "TotalCoinSupply" through hvplot.
